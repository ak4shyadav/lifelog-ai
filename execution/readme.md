# Execution Scripts

This folder contains deterministic Python scripts that perform specific actions.

## Guidelines
- Scripts should be well-commented.
- Use environment variables from `.env` for secrets.
- Handle errors gracefully and return meaningful messages/logs.
- Prefer scripts over manual LLM actions for repeatable or sensitive tasks.
